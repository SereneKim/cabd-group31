What are the characteristics of antivaxxers during the COVD-19 pandemic? In order to
inquire into this research question, we adopted two types of analyses: (1) Supervised
ML techniques based on a survey data (2) Unsupervised ML techniques on a Twitter data.
The former type of data has an advantage for the researchers to explore the respondents'
behaviors and attitudes towards the variables that they are interested in. The latter
data type, on the other hand, is useful when exploring the general discussions about a
certain topic - which in our case, is Covid vaccines. Adopting these two approaches are
advantageous for us to answer the research question that we have, as they can complement
each other's weaker points. This is also to say that the survey data may support or refute the insights that we gain from the Twitter data, vice versa. Such a comparison itself will provide ....

In the following, we first present the surpervised ML techniques applied to a survey data and then the text analysis on a Twitter data set. 


# II.  Text Analysis on Twitter Data

We will use a data set provided by .... . This is because scraping tweets with Twitter API only allows us to scrape the recent tweets. Although there are some scrapers that provide a tool to scrape old tweets, we avoided such a tool since their legality was not clear. 

By contrast, the data set by ... was publicly available. However, since Twitter only allows to distribute the tweet ID's rather than the full texts, a tool to regenerate the tweets is needed. For this, we used Python using .... and saved the tweets in the text format.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
